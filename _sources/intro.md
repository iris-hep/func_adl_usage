# func_adl Users Manual

This is a user's manual that shows you how to use `func_adl` to access and stream data locally and on ServiceX.

Knowledge of python is good, but no prior knowledge of `func_adl` is required. The book includes `hello world` samples as well as sections discussing all the concepts. While it is expected the _Basic Concepts_ section should be read in approximate order, the rest of the book can be read in any order.
